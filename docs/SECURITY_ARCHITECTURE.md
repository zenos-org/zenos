# ZENOS security architecture (single source of truth)

5 layers. Each concern has ONE owning module. Do not duplicate crypto, ledger, or firewall logic elsewhere.

## Module ownership
- Crypto (fragment + per-fragment keys): /usr/local/lib/zenos/zfrag.py  (zenos.py delegates; no AES elsewhere)
- Tamper-evident ledger (hash chain): /usr/local/lib/zenos/zledger.py  (audit() delegates)
- Sensor + reflex + agent: /usr/local/sbin/zenos_netsentinel.py (+ zenos-netsense.bt)
- Security monitor feed: /usr/sbin/zenos_secstat.py (zenos-secstat.service). Read-only: counts ZENOS_IN drops (and the rate-limited "ZENOS_IN_DROP " log line for source/port), PAM sign-in failures and sentinel incidents; writes /run/zenos/secstat.json for the System Monitor. Changes no rule.
- Open-time network cut (L4+): /usr/local/sbin/zenos_openguard.py
- Sensor liveness (dead-man's switch): /usr/local/sbin/zenos_heartbeat.py
- Inbound firewall: /usr/local/sbin/zenos-firewall

## iptables chain map (three separate chains, never overlap)
- ZENOS_IN   : inbound. Owner: zenos-firewall. lo RETURN; ESTABLISHED,RELATED RETURN; new non-lo DROP.
- ZENOS_OUT  : egress reflex. Owner: netsentinel. Per-incident DROP of a destination.
- ZENOS_OPEN : open-time cut. Owner: zenos_openguard. lo RETURN; ESTABLISHED,RELATED RETURN; else DROP.
Rule: each chain is inserted/removed only by its owner. No module touches another's chain.

## Open sequence (fixed order)
fetch keys (ledger: key-issue) -> cut network (L4+) -> decrypt + view -> re-seal + wipe plaintext -> restore network -> ledger: file-close

## Deliberate interactions
- During an L4+ open window egress is cut, so the agent's external-model call is unavailable; the
  agent falls back to local policy. This is fail-closed and intended, not a bug.
- firewall-watch (netsentinel) re-arms ZENOS_IN only; it does not touch ZENOS_OPEN/ZENOS_OUT.

## Escape routes during use (only two)
- network -> sensor/reflex/agent + open-time cut
- screen  -> clipboard disabled; software screenshot limited; watermark for attribution; camera = physical + watermark

## Attribution chain
key-issue + file-open/close recorded per actor+device in zledger, replicated across grid nodes.
Leak -> ledger names who had access; watermark names whose copy leaked.

## Ledger tiers (edit history: how much to record, where)
Two tiers, so routine edits don't bloat the consortium or the reviewer.
- Local tier (cheap, high-frequency): every save/edit appended to a light per-file hash chain, kept on
  the local grid nodes (fragmented + replicated). Tamper-evident, but a compromised node can rewrite
  its own copy, so this tier is NOT the trust root.
- Consortium tier (authoritative, low-frequency): only the critical events, plus a periodic Merkle-root
  anchor of the local batch. The anchor is the trust root: comparing it against the local chain detects
  any local rewrite. Same pattern as blockchain L2->L1 anchoring and AWS CloudTrail hourly digests.

Recorded individually on the consortium (infrequent, attribution-critical):
  file-open, file-close, key-issue, access-grant, anomaly, agent-decision, external-send.
Batched then anchored (frequent): ordinary edits/saves.
Anchor cadence (default): on file-close, and every N edits or every T minutes, whichever first.

## Cost
Permissioned consortium (ministry nodes) has NO per-transaction gas/fee. Cost = storage + replication +
human review. One record ~ a few hundred bytes; a permissioned chain sustains thousands of tx/sec, so
throughput is not the constraint. Batching+anchoring cuts on-chain rows by ~100x (100 edits -> 1 anchor
row), keeping both storage and the reviewer's view small. Net: negligible cost at government scale.

## Durability (survive sudden shutdown)
Change-point capture is integrated at the viewer/OS level (automatic, like autosave; not user-triggered).
- Local tier is a write-ahead log: fsync to disk (and to local grid nodes) BEFORE the edit is acked, so a
  power loss cannot lose an acknowledged change.
- Consortium anchor is asynchronous; an entry is marked "anchored" only after the consortium confirms receipt.
- Boot reconciler: on startup, any local entries not yet anchored are re-sent to the consortium. Idempotent
  via the entry hash, so re-sending after a crash creates no duplicate.
- Result: a sudden shutdown loses at most an edit the user never durably saved (same as any autosave gap);
  everything acknowledged survives and the consortium catches up after reboot.
Pattern: database write-ahead logging + CloudTrail-style local-then-digest; neither loses committed records.

## New owned modules (send-check + two-tier anchor)
- Pre-send gate: /usr/share/zenos/bin/zenos_sendcheck.py  (plaintext/unsealed/tampered -> block; over the huge
  line -> allowed only with an approved 申請; every decision logged to the ledger)
- Two-tier anchor: /usr/local/lib/zenos/zanchor.py  (local fine-grained chain + periodic Merkle-root anchor
  to the consortium)
Detection split (verified): per-record hash (zledger.verify) catches a single edited record; the consortium
Merkle anchor (zanchor.verify_anchor) catches a full self-consistent re-chain of the local tier.

## Security Note (endpoint audit + double-check)
Module: /usr/local/lib/zenos/zsecnote.py. Periodically, per endpoint: anchor new local edits, then run the
hard checks and emit a verdict (trusted | SUSPECT) logged to the consortium ledger.
- Soft (management metadata, NOT a security root): hostname, kernel, connected devices + models. A
  compromised endpoint can forge these, so they never decide trust on their own.
- Hard (trust root): local ledger integrity, consortium ledger integrity, local<->consortium reconciliation
  (zanchor.verify_anchor), sensor liveness. The reconciliation is the double-check: a kernel-compromised
  endpoint can rebuild a self-consistent local chain but cannot match the anchors it already committed to
  the consortium, so the mismatch exposes the modified OS. Attestation (measured boot) strengthens trust in
  the self-reported inventory but is not yet implemented (target B).
Verified: stealth tamper (self-consistent local rewrite) -> SUSPECT(local-vs-consortium-mismatch).
Remaining wiring: run the audit on a resident timer across endpoints; call zenos_sendcheck at each transfer point.

## Machine health (watch the computer, not the person)
Folded into zsecnote. Framing: resource/behavioral signals are device monitoring, not surveillance of staff.
Collected: GPU utilization + temperature (nvidia-smi), CPU load ratio (loadavg). On real endpoints also add
CPU temperature + fan (lm-sensors/IPMI; not available under WSL).
Takeover signatures flagged: gpu-busy-while-deskwork, gpu-overheat, cpu-sustained-high.
Separation (important): verdict = hard tamper checks (trusted|SUSPECT); attention = soft health alerts that
raise attention / feed the AI audit, never by themselves a tamper verdict. Thresholds tunable; idle deskwork
GPU baseline is ~0%. Verified on real + synthetic readings.

## Machine health: network throughput
Added to zsecnote.health via net_rates() reading /proc/net/dev twice over an interval (Task-Manager
"Network" equivalent): whole-machine tx/rx bytes/sec across non-lo interfaces. Alert
"sustained-outbound-high" when deskwork tx exceeds NET_TX_HI (default 5 MB/s, tunable). This is a coarse
whole-machine corroboration independent of the per-connection eBPF sensor. Verified: idle=0 (no false
positive), live burst measured ~8.3 MB/s, synthetic high -> alert.

## Sign-in with the phone (zenos_credd)

Passwords saved in the ZENOS Browser are kept by a root service, encrypted with a key that only the person's phone
produces: the phone's passkey derives it for each entry (WebAuthn PRF) after the phone verifies the person by
fingerprint, face or PIN. A stolen PC or a copied disk yields only ciphertext.

1. The browser finds a password field on a page it loaded over verified HTTPS and offers to sign in. The origin comes
   from the browser (top-level address and TLS state), never from the page; the script that finds the field runs in an
   isolated script world the page cannot reach.
2. The vault service makes a request (id, site, account, time, a one-time key, the entry's salt) and the browser
   shows a two-digit code. ZENOS Messages wakes the linked phone.
3. The phone shows the site, the account and three codes. The person picks the code on the PC and confirms with
   fingerprint or face. The passkey signs the request's digest; the entry's key goes to the service encrypted to the
   request's one-time key. ZENOS Messages only carries it.
4. The service checks the passkey facts and `zenos-decide` decides (`cred_sound`, `cred_once`). The password goes only
   to the browser process that asked, which fills it only into the same tab, same page load, same origin.

Saving a password takes the same approval. At most 3 prompts per minute reach the phone (`ask_bounded`).
Phones are registered with a one-time enrolment code from the administrator (`sudo zenos_credd.py --enroll USER`);
`--phones USER` lists them and `--revoke USER PHONE` removes one (passwords saved with it can no longer be opened).

The service answers only the installed ZENOS Browser and ZENOS Messages (it checks the connecting process's program
file, interpreter, environment and debugger state). That is a hurdle, not a wall: a program of the same user can
rewrite how its own command line looks, so the check stops casual misuse, not a determined local attacker.

Not protected: a PC already taken over at the moment of signing in (the password is in the page then), and a program
of the same user that imitates the browser's request (the person still sees the site on the phone and must pick the
code shown by the ZENOS Browser). The phone page is served by the PC's ZENOS Messages through the tunnel, and its
passkey is bound to the tunnel's host: a new tunnel host needs the phone enrolled again.
